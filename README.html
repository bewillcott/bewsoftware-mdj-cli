<h1>Markdownj CLI</h1>

<p>Command-line program that uses the Markdownj Core library.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>This is a program under active development.  It is not yet ready for release.
However, I have placed it here for public reference purposes.</p>

<p>Feel free to clone what is here, but realise that I am still working on it.  The documentation
is limited.  That is part of the work in progress.</p>

<h2>Dependancies</h2>

<p>You will also need two other repositories to compile this one:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bewillcott/bewcommons">BEWCommons Library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bewillcott/markdownj">Markdownj Core Library</a></li>
</ul>
