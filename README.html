<h1>MDj CLI</h1>

<p>Command-line program that uses the MDj Core library.</p>

<p>This is a renamed package.  It was the Markdownj-Cli project, and the core
was Markdownj-Core<a href="#fn1" title="Original source on Github"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.  However, as I have done a lot of code changes to the core
library and plan to publish both this program and the core, I believe that the
rename was necessary.  Further, the code in both has been refactored to a new
package basename of: <code>com.bewsoftware.mdj.*</code>.  <code>bewsoftware.com</code> is a domain 
name that I now own.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>This is a program under active development.  It is not yet ready for release.
However, I have placed it here for public reference purposes.</p>

<p>Feel free to clone what is here, but realize that I am still working on it.  The documentation
is limited.  That is part of the work in progress.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>You will also need two other repositories to compile this one:</p>
