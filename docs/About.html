<p>MDj CLI came about because of my need as a programmer to produce readily 
accessible end-user documentation for the software I was developing. I am
by nature, lazy.  Probably why I got into programming in the first place,
as I love having a computer do for me what I was too lazy to do for myself.</p>

<p>I wanted a way of producing good looking documentation without having to 
code html, or some other verbose descriptive language.  When I came
across Markdownj, I believed I had found my solution.  Unfortunately, it
was only part way there.  The library I found[1] had not been updated in
more than 7 years.  Further, I was not aware of any command-line utility 
that used it.</p>

<p>I decided to take on the project of achieving both.  First, I had to update
the code to work with a later version of the JDK, currently 12.  Along the way
I added many features, such as "Fenced Code Blocks".  </p>

<p>Then came the task of the cli tool.  This gave me more opportunities to
enhance the capabilities of the markdown syntax.  Among other things, I added
"Meta Blocks".  Very similar to that used on GitHub Pages.  I also added
the use of an 'ini' file to configure <strong>mdj-cli</strong> on a project/book level.</p>

<p>Though the current version is fully functional, I am still adding to it.
I will continue to do so as I find a need for a feature it currently doesn't
have.  So, feel free to grab a copy of the code, or the binaries.  If you 
find some little feature you'd like to have that isn't there, email me.
I might have a use for it as well.</p>
