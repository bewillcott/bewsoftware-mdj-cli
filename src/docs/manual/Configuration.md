##[#top] Configuration

MDj CLI is configured via an _ini_ file: `mdj-cli.ini`.  If [setup] properly,
this file should be either in your project directory, or in the root directory of the
document you are working on.

Let us look at the default `mdj-cli.ini` file:

[Home]:index.html
[setup]:Setup.html
