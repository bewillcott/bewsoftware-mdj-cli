# Markdownj CLI
Command-line program that uses the Markdownj Core library.

## Status
This is a program under active development.  It is not yet ready for release.
However, I have placed it here for public reference purposes.

Feel free to clone what is here, but realise that I am still working on it.  The documentation
is limited.  That is part of the work in progress.

## Dependancies
You will also need two other repositories to compile this one:

- [BEWCommons Library][bewc]
- [Markdownj Core Library][mjc]



[bewc]:https://github.com/bewillcott/bewcommons
[mjc]:https://github.com/bewillcott/markdownj
