# Markdownj CLI
Command-line program that uses the Markdownj Core library.

## Status
This is a program under active development.  It is not yet ready for release.
However, I have placed it here for public reference purposes.

Feel free to clone what is here, but realize that I am still working on it.  The documentation
is limited.  That is part of the work in progress.

## Dependencies
You will also need two other repositories to compile this one:

- [BEWLibs Library][bewl]!
- [Markdownj Core Library][mjc]!



[bewl]:https://github.com/bewillcott/bewlibs
[mjc]:https://github.com/bewillcott/markdownj
