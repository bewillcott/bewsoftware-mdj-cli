# MDj CLI
Command-line program that uses the MDj Core library.

This is a renamed package.  It was the Markdownj-Cli project, and the core
was Markdownj-Core.  However, as I have done a lot of code changes to the core
library and plan to publish both this program and the core, I believe that the
rename was necessary.  Further, the code in both has been refactored to a new
package basename of: `com.bewsoftware.mdj.*`.  `bewsoftware.com` is a domain 
name that I now own.

## Status
This is a program under active development.  It is not yet ready for release.
However, I have placed it here for public reference purposes.

Feel free to clone what is here, but realize that I am still working on it.  The documentation
is limited.  That is part of the work in progress.

## Dependencies
You will also need two other repositories to compile this one:

- [BEWLibs Library][bewl]!
- [MDj Core Library][mjc]!
